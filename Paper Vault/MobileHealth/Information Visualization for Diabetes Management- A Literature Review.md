### 3.3 Strategies
- [[Coping with Volume and Variety in Temporal Event Sequences- Strategies for Sharpening Analytic Focus]]
- Extraction Strategies
	- extraction strategies focus the analysis on a subset of the data
	- Goal-driven record or event category extraction strategies
	- Alignment strategies
- Folding Strateiges
	- Temporal folding strategies split long streams of data into smaller units such as inidividual days.
- Pattern Simplification Strategies
	- Pattern simplification strategies focus on reducing variety by replacing complicated sequences with simpler ones.
	- Grouping event categories / Coalescing repeating point events

## 4 Discussion
- Adopt analytic strategies to help sharpen the focus when analyzing multi-dimensional and complex chroic illness data
- Showing all records using superimposed views is likely to create high visual clutter, and thus make it challenging to analyze the data.
