### 5.2.3 Designing Encodings
For each data table T ∈Γ, Compass applies visualization design best practices drawn from by prior research [4, 9, 24, 25, 42] to generate and rank a set of encodings ET (C3)
- considering
	- Permitted encoding channels for each data type in Compass, ordered by perceptua effectiveness rankings.
	- Required and permitted encoding channels by mark type.
	- Permitted mark types based on the data types of the x and y channels. N, O, T, Q denote nominal, ordinal, temporal and quantitative types, repectively.
	- Encoding channel groups used to perform clustering.

- **Ranking.** 
- Compass ranks the generated encodings using perceptual effectiveness metrics. Compass applies prior work by Cleveland [8] and Mackinlay [24] to rank the effectiveness of each visual channel based on a variable’s data type
