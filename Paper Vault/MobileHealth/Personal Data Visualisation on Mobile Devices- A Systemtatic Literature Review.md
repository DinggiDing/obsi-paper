- Although there are many personal tracking apps, the user experience when using these apps and visualisations is not evaluated yet.
- There are no studies on the best pracitces of personal data visualisation on mobile devices, assessment frameworks for data visualisation, or design framework for personal data visualisations

# 1 Introduction
---
RQ
- What personal data does end-users want to track?
- What are the different backgrounds and skills of personal data visualisation end users?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of adopting mobile devices in tracking and visualising personal data?
- What are the visualisation techniques and visualisation tasks covered in the literature in personal data visualisation?

# 3 Methodology
---
- ("mobile data visualisation") OR ("personal analytics" AND "data visualisation" AND "mobile") in the search engine (2010-2020)
- 28 papers

# 4 Results
---
- The following section will present the results based on five aspect
	- types of self-tracked data
	- user profile
	- target mobile devices
	- visualisation tasks and techniques
	- user feedback
### 4.1 Self-Tracked Personal Data
- Among these personal data, health condition was the most data tha have been studied
### 4.2 Type of Users
- 2 groups, Firstly, the public who are interested in self-tracking. Secondly, users who have been recruited to evaluate an application of framework
	- group 1 : The study(20) focused on developing an application that supports users sleeping patterns. The participants involved evaluated the application based on its learnability, appeal, and distraction
- Although 6 papers have focused on public users, these studies focused on types of tracked personal data  but not visualising these data. Therefore, more studies are needed on how public users interact with visualising their data.
### 4.3 Mobile Devices- Benefits and Challenges
- We classified these papers into 2 groups, the former is related to papers that targeted smartphone applications in terms of building and evaluating them, and the latter is related to combining smartphone and wearable devices.
	- group 1 : The latest study focused on evaluating the usability of 62 applicants in order to build an application that enables users to customise their tracking activity and study
- We found that, small screen is the main issues of adopting personal data visualisation on mobile devices. Futhermore, scale-ability, battery drain and limited functionality issues were results of studies conducted in reviewing applications.
- In contrast, the built in sensors, powerful processor, high resolution display, providing personal space, low maintenance and easy access to data have supported mobile devices to be adopted in visualizing personal data.
### 4.4 Visualisation Tasks and Techniques
- we classify visualisation features into 3 general aspects
	- visualisation tasks
	- visualisation types
	- visualisation techniques
		- data storytelling
		- to representing data physically
		- visualisation are adding natural language to give a description
		- auto-generated visualisation
### 4.5 Feedback
- Firstly, there are 3 papers involved in reviewing used visualisation types and users engagement.
	- In study(3), To summarise the results of this study, the researcher has collected the users' feedback and found that line graph is not easy to be understood by everyone, time series as a graph is the most used visualisation type as it is easy to track various progressing.
- Secondly, 4 papers summarised the recommendation that users stated in the application/prototype that they reviewed.
	- For instance, colour coding was confusing for some users, and other users claim that the application was limited in terms of further exploring data.
