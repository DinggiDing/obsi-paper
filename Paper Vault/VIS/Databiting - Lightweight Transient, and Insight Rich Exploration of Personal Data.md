- mobile data exploration
- glanceable and micro visulization / heavyweight applications의 사이  →  Lightweight, transient

#### mobile data exploration
1.  glanceable and micro visulization
	- specific insights and allow limited interaction →  No personal and situational needs
2. heavyweight applications
	- more comprehensive data exploration
	- considerable time and knowledge to use > inaccessible or inconvenient

#### Example
1. The smartwatch initially displays only current metrics
2. Seeking a deeper understanding
	1. Taps and holds on the number(on the metrics)
	2. Add a natural language query
	3. Appear a graph about the query

#### 5 research considerations
- Contextual factors
- Interaction modalities
- Complementary relationship between databiting and other forms of exploration
- Personalization
- Evaluation challeges


## Personal Data Exploration
- PI's goal
	- people's unique needs and patterns of usage
	- technology, interaction, data representation
- The Important thing is that individuals can explore and interact with their data
- Current interfaces on mobile devices often lack [[Affordance]] to provide richer and personalized insight.
	- No interaction, Filtering options


## Databiting Concept
- "Databiting" = easily consumable snack (bite-sized information)
- **Time, Effort**
- Databiting is well-suited for smartwatches and other wearable devices


## Research Considerations
#### Contextual Factors
- Databiting is integrated with **contextual information**(time, personal preferences and location history)
- The integration of contextual data can enhance in-situ insights
#### Interaction Modalities
- A multimodal approach can be used, combining **natural language** and the device's primary interaction method, due to the limited interaction space
#### Databiting and Broader Exploration
- Databiting serves as a stepping stone for in-depth data exploration
	- How people transition from databiting to in-depth exploration
	- How previous in-depth exploration influnces future databiting
#### Personalization
- People can focus actionable outcomes of databiting rather than the exploratory process
#### Evaluation Challenges
- It is challenge to evaluate Databiting
- Understanding the impact of databiting compared to glanceable and micro visualizations, and longer form data exploration would also be valuable.
