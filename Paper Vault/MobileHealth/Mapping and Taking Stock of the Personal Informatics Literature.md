Integration is often studied and supported in domain-specific contexts. For example, platforms have aggregated and summarized data relevant to a domain, such as Lullaby and SleepExplorer for sleep [129,171] and ArmSleeve for stroke recovery monitoring [220]. However, we also observed many platforms which aim to aggregate a variety of health data across domains, such as 360° Quantified Self [108] and AGILE [192].
