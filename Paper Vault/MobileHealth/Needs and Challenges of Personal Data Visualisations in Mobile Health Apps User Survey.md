- The main challenges are the lack of interaction with the presented charts, the complexity of the presented data andthe inconsistency of chart's presentation.
- In contrast, complete and customizable charts that are easy to read encourage frequent app use.

# 1 Introduction
---
- In the paper, we focus on non-expert mobile health app users with little no experience with data visualisation
- Based on [[Analysis of Personal Data Visualization Reviews on mHealth Apps]]
- RQ 1 : What are the most common data visualisation tasks and goals users want to achieve?
- RQ 2 : What do users like or dislike in the data visualisations provided by their apps?
- RQ 3 : What are the key user requirements to improve their experience when using data visualisation in these apps?

# 2 Study Design
---
- We designed the study based on the *design thinking process* and the *value proposition canvas* as the two widely adopted.
- These approaches were chosen as they were adopted in devloping and envaluating mHealth apps.
