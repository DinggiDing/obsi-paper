Marginalized population
- focus of target users (many charateristics) like lay individuals, nerodivergent people
- interaction behaviors are not typical  (conversation with adults and childs)  →  (challenges)
- LLM-driven CA research for marginalized population (NAVER AI LAB)

conversatinal AI, agent, dialogsystem, chatbot(like chatGPT)
- Tasks of CAS(COnversational characteristics)
	- task-oriented systems
	- open-domatin system(clova, chatgpt)
	- LLM for chatbots
		- for open-ended conversation
		- context follow up

- Understading the ~ long-term memory on self-disclosure (CHI24)

- CHACHA (CHI24)
	- "parenting intervention" for emotional communication
