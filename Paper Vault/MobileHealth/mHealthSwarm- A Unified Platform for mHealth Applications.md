- In this paper, we present a new approach and a platform for mHealth apps - micro mHealth apps, and we discuss them as an alternative to the current mHealth app development model.

# 1 Introduction
---
- Users dislike downloading multiple apps as they uneccessarily increase the number of applications on their smartphones.
- many users stop using mhealth apps due to the burden of repeated data entry, hidden costs and confusion around several apps.
- They still do not solve the problem of data sharing between multiple apps, integration of wearables and peripherals, a uniform UX/UX and app features customization.
- micro-mHealth apps will offer a better experience for both end users and mHealth app developers saving a lot of effort, time and money.

# 2 Motivation
---
- In the case of data visualization, users can find that their apps present similar visualizations to track thier blood pressure.
- The survey showed that users expect a lot more from current apps and prefer a single platform that allows feature customization to build an application meeting all their needs without any additional bloat.

# 3 Our platform
---
- Application Manager
- Data Manager
- Device Manager
- Conversation Manager

- To evaluate our platform and its feature customizability with end users, we implemented core functions (workout tracking, meal tracking, mood tracking) inspired from 3 popuplar apps.

# 5 Discussion
---
- Despite the advantages(hybrid application), this customizability comes with some drawbacks, such as an added overhead for learning the platform functionality and slightly lower micro-app performance.
- In terms of functionality, our mHealthSwarm platform is currently limited to an external heart rate monitor, built-in sensors, GPS and camera.
