- Our exploratory study involving ten young adults with Down Syndrome idntifies several design opportunities to improve the accessibility of health data visualizations(HDVs) by addressing the cascade of negative effects caused by inference-making barriers in HDVs

- RQ 1 : What are the graphicacy skills of people with Down Syndrome as they read and make sense of the information presented in health data visualizations?
- RQ 2 : What accessible health data visualization design opportunities are there to better support people with Down Syndrome's abilities as they interact with health information?

### 2.2 Literacies and skills in Health Data Visualizations
- Health Data Visualization Literacy  - Print Literacy, Health Literacy, Data Literacy, Numeracy, Graphicacy
	- Print Literacy : ability to read (phonology, orthography, semantics, morphology)
	- Numeracy : one-third of English-speaking Americans have low numeracy skills
	- Data Literacy : newest type of essential 21st century skill necessary for full participation in an increasingly data-driven society
	- Graphicacy : reading the data, reading between the data, and reading beyond the data
		- reading the data : title, x-axix, value, size, shape
		- reading between the data : pattern, differences, outliers
		- reading beyond the data : long-term memory, domain acknowledge
	- Health Literacy : understanding evaluating health information

- They use 6 charts(table, bar chart, line chart, scatter plot) from medical resources, news, or health apps. 



- 이 연구는 다운 증후군(Down Syndrome)을 가진 청년들이 개인 건강 데이터를 시각화한 정보를 읽고, 해석하고, 이해하는 능력을 조사하고자 했습니다. 연구는 특히 건강 데이터 시각화(Health Data Visualizations, HDVs)를 읽을 때 직면하는 장벽과 디자인 개선 가능성을 파악하는 데 중점을 두었습니다.

- 논문 2.2에서 Health Data Visualization Literacy를 구성하기 위해 필요한 5가지 Literacy(Print Literacy, Health Literacy, Data Literacy, Numeracy, Graphicacy)가 있음.
