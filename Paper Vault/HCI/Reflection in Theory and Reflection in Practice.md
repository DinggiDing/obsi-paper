The paper aims to identify how commercial personal informatics apps support **reflection**(inducing positive behavior change or generating deeper insights into personal habits) and to suggest improvements based on theoretical frameworks.

- In their investigation of 123 commerical PI apps, they found lack of features that encourage user-driven reflection, scaffolding for setting goals and configuring data collection and presentation, and consideration of wider implications stand to limit meaning-making and frustrate nuanced insight generation based on lived experiences

# 1 Introduction
- Most PI research, including two broadly-cited PI models
	1. Li et al.'s Stage-Based Model of Personal Informatics
	2. Epstein et al.'s Lived Informatics Model(semi-automated, fully auto, manuall)
##### Contributions
- Extend Fleck and Fitzpatrick's theoretical framework of *reflection* to further operationalize each level of reflection in design features relavent to PI systems
- Discuss the ways in which reflective pratices are-and are not supported in current PI apps
- Provide implications about how reflection could be better supported in PI systems
