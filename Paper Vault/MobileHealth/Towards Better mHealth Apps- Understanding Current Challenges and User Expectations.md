- We surveyed 70 people over the age of 18 having experience with mHealth apps and found issues such as limited customizability, unwanted and redundant features, and data entry challenges that lead to a degraded UX overall. 

# 1 Introduction
---
- A significant number of health application users also stop using such services due to issues such as hidden costs and a significant burden of data entry which also affects app usability.
- RQ 1 : What are the main challenges end-users face when using more than one mHealth app?
- RQ 2 : What are the expectations end-users have of their future mHealth apps?
- The study was based on the constructs of the Technology AcceptanceModel(TAM), the Mobile App Rating Scale(MARS) and the Value Proposition Canvas to identify the pains users face with current mHealth apps and expected gains from the future apps


# 3 Methodology
---
- We designed a user study combining the TAM constructs of Perceived Usefulness and Ease of Use, and the MARS constructs of Design and Aesthetics, Engagement and Functionality. These segments were then aligned with the Pains and Gains components of the Value Proposition Canvas
- Our sruvey questions were based on these dimensions which were than arranged into four blocks to obtain details around
	1. Usage pattern to identify the kind of apps being and the user's objectives
	2. App discovery and acceptance
	3. Key challenges around using mHealth apps(pain component)
	4. Expentations from furture health apps(gain component)

# 4 Result

### 1 Challenges with current mHealth apps
- Installing and managing several apps - A sizeable number(42.9%) agreed with a smaller number disagreeing(24.3%)
- Functional overlaps and unused features - Most users(45.7%) indicated they found overlaps between features offered by different apps and that they also provide functions that they don't intend to use(40%)
- Data collection and management - half of users(55.7%) dislike for manual data entry across several mHealth apps
### 2 Expections from future mHealth apps
- The need for a single app and feature customization
	- most respondents preferred a unified platform for managing their health data(44.3% + 34.3%)
	- respondents were more inclined towards a highly customizable app that would allow then to customizable features according to needs(44.3% + 34.3%)
- Support for automation
	- majority of the respondents indicated a strong preference for automation(64.3%)

- Similarly, another concern could be around security and privacy where a single platform has control over all their health data
### 2 Emerging Implications for Developers
- End-user feature toggles - A better approach perhaps would be to make apps customizable using feature toggles to manage an app's complexity and appeal.
- Prevent redundant feature sets - Allowing users to personalize app features can help remove this redundancy and we speculate that a single, customizable app supporting individual features as app plugins could help overcome this challenge.
- Data Collection - while manual data entry is necessary for several reasons, users dislike repetitive manual entry specially if the data is already available on their smartphones
