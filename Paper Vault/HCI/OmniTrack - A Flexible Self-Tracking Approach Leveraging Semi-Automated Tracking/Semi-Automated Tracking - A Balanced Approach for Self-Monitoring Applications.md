- We suspect that this is partially because the complete automation of data collection significantly reduces the awareness, accountability, and involvement achieved compared to when a person actively engages in manual tracking
- The research addresses the limitations of fully manual or automated tracking systems, which often lead to either **high user burden** or **reduced engagement**.
→  find the right balance between manual and automated tracking, combining each of their benefits while minimizing their associated limitations (= Semi-automated tracking)

### Design Considerations for semi-automated tracking
- Self-monitoring technology 3 components
	1. the person who tracked
	2. the behavior of interest captured through data
	3. the system that assists with the data capture
- Semi-automated 3 parameter
	1. data capture feasibility
	2. the purpose of self-monitoring
	3. a person's motivation level
- Manual and Automated tracking involve a trade-off
