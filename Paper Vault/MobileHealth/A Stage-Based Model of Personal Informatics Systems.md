- We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages(preparation→  collection →  integration →  reflection →  action) and identified barriers in each of the stages.
- user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience

- There are 2 core aspect to every personal informatics system: collection , reflection
### Integration Stage
- _Integration_ is the stage that lies between the Collection and Reflection stages, where the information collected are prepared, combined, and transformed for the user to reflect on.
- Integration Barriers: Transcribing data, Organization, Scattered visualizations, Multiple Inputs
### Reflection Stage
- Reflection Barriers: Lack of time, Visualization, Self-criticism, Interpretation, Search, No context, Sparse data, Data is not useful

- Problems in each stage affect the later stages.
- Problems in the Integration stage, such as scattered visualizations and difficult organization, make reflection harder.
