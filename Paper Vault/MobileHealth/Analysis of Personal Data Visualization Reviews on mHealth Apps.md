- App reviews offer an indirect anchor for researchers to examine how non-expert users perceive and interact with data visualisations and identify the key challenges and recommendations

# 1 Introduction
---
- Graphs, charts, and icons are the main components of health tracking apps that help users track their goals, habits, and achievements (Choe, Dachselt, Isenberg & Lee, 2019)
- RQ 1 : What are the common visualisation tasks and charts that have been adopted in mHealthapps?
- RQ 2 : What are the top data visualisation issues in health tracking apps?
- RQ 3 : What guidelines can we provide based on user reviews to improve user experience?

# 2 Data collection
---
- We had 2,750,000 app reviews for the 217 apps, 8,406 rows(reviews) related to data visualisation

# 3 Results and analysis
---
- RQ 1 
	- Iconography was the most adopted visualisation type, Line and bar charts are the second most common charts
	- In terms of visualisation tasks, developers have focused only on one primary mission: tracking progress. These apps did not cover other visualisation tasks - e.g. comparing, filtering, ordering, grouping, maximum and minimum. Therefore, there is a lack of interaction with the presented charts.
- RQ 2 
	- 4 main issues realted to data visualisation design
		- Chart scaling issues (40%)
		- Graph styling (font size, chart ranges, colous do not indicate meaningful information, including grid lines in the charts and axis titles)
		- Interactivity (scrolling, zooming, landscape, choose graph options)
		- The chart type is not appropriate (bar chart, pie chart)
	- Issues
		- Missing graphs - missing functionalities
		- Chart scailing, graph layout-graph color- small graph size
		- Not showing information correctively
		- Missing the chart type - font - no interactivity- colours - zooming problem
		- Missing graph information
		- Chart not working - two colour menus confusing

# 4 Discussion
---
#### Developing data visualisation
- For example, adopting a complete set of functional requirements and data related to users control and understanding of the graphs. That is, users should control their entries and chart their progress easily.
- For example, the touch, tap and rotating interaction are facilities provided by smartphone manufactures that enable users to navigate and control their app screen easily.

# 5 Conclusion
---
- We found that the number of positive reviews is more than negative reviews, so users generally happy about the data visualisations in these apps.
