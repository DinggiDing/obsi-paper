- indicated challenges such as functional overlaps between different apps, unnecessary featrues, and poor customizability. Similarly, most respondents expressed their preference for a single platform to manage their health.

# 1 Introduction
---
- Numerous applications are available without any review of their contents, and thus may contain poor quality information or can also be completely irrelevant, making it very challenging for users to locate applications and to make an informed decision around which applications to use.
- Most apps do not offer comprehensive feature sets.
- Users also abandon their mHealth apps after using them a couple of times.
- We designed an online survey using constructs from the Mobile App rating Scale(MARS) and the Technology Acceptance Model(TAM) and the Value Proposition Canvas to help us explore the above among mHealth app users.

- several applications are available, where some are more suitable for centain activities.
- Although the major smartphone operating system(iOS and Android) offer *robust data sharing mechanisms* through frameworks like Apple Health and Google Fit, not all apps have these features implemented.

# 2 Methodology
---
- TAM, MARS, the Value Proposition Canvas
- Our survey focused on 5 key dimensions
	1. Dicovery and Acceptance
	2. Functionality
	3. Design and Aesthetics
	4. Usability/Ease-of-use
	5. Data management

# 3 Result
---
### B. Usage pattern
- Of the available app categories, fitness applications were found to be the most popular with 42.7% of the respondents using them.
- a wider use of fitness hardware and this is reflected in the responses where the most popular choices were found to be fitness wearables such as smartwatches and smart rings.(51%)
- Similarly, for app acceptance, we found poor application design as the biggest reason why users abandon apps(24%)
### C. Challenges with Current mHealth Apps
- We expected most users to agree to the need for installing and managing more than one mHealth app.
- However, we found a mixed response, with 32.9% of the respondents remaining neutral. Several respondents(30%) also agreed to the statement, with a smaller number disagreeing(17.1%).
- Most respondents(45.7% agreeing with 15.7% strongly agreeing) indicated the presence of feature overlaps across different apps, along with functions they don't find useful
- A major pain when using several apps is around data management.
- users may need to enter duplicate data manually across applications. Although frameworks like Google Fit enable data sharing between them, not all applications support them.
- Most users(40%) also accepted storing their health data on the cloud, which can also indicate their desire for simplified data mangement.
### D. Expectations from future mHealth Apps
- Given the challenges associated with the use of several mHealth apps, a strong preference for high levels of feature customizability was observed(34.3% strongly agree, 44.3% agree) where users can personlise a single app with features they need.
- We noticed a strong user preference for automated data collection(64.3%)


# 4 Dicussion
---
### A. Discovery and Usage pattern
- Most users in each age group(except 51-60) were found to have used between 2-4 mHealth apps highlighting the user need to install additional apps to monitor and manage their health. This However, when coupled with overlapping and unused feature, degrades the overall user experience.
### B. Challenges
- This was confirmed by the responses, where many of the respondents were either neutral(32.9%) or indicated they needed multiple apps for managing their health(42.9%)
- when several apps are used together, additional bloat was also reported by participants needing just one app, indicating that mHealth apps do not necessarily need to have extra features in addition to the core functionality.
- when using more than one app, over half of the participants(55.7%) expressed their dissatisfaction with manual data logging across the different apps they use. Although the latest version of popular mobile operating systems support some mechanism of data sharing, such as Apple's healthkit framework and the Google Fit framework, not all apps may support them.
- common challenges such as the need for the additional apps, unnecessary features, overlapping functionality and data entry across several apps remained.
### C. Expectations
- most participants preferred a single app offering all the features they require(78.6%)
- Most users(84.3%) expressed their preference of a single mHealth platform with only a few of the opposite opinion, possibly because of concerns around a single platform having control over all their heatlh information.(privacy and security of health data)
- However, these concerns can be addressed by using open-source systems that are fully transparent around data storage and managemnet. (like one's own local system)
- In our previous short paper[[Towards Better mHealth Apps- Understanding Current Challenges and User Expectations]], we dicussed challenges around necessary and redundant features and presented a potential solution through the use of feature toggles to provide user-customisable app features.
- Design consistency - Most of the participants noted their observation of inconsistent app designs and indicated their preference for consistent and uniform interfaces.


# 5 Conclusion
---
- 70 valid responsed highlighting the user's need to use more than one mHealth service, with many arguing for the need to use several apps eve for achieving one goal.
- This also indicates the presence of unused features in each app along with redundant features between different apps, suggesting the need for customisable apps that allow features-level personalisation allowing one to remove this duplication.
- Participants also indicated their dislike for repetitive data entry, especially when the same data is entered into several apps.
