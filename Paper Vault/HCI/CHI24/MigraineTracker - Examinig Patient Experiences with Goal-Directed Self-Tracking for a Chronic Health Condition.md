- exmined migraine patient experience in a deployment study for an average of 12+ months
- chronic condition management(편두통), Self-tracking, Goal-directed tracking

# 1 Introduction
---
- self-tracking condition for chronic conditions like migraine is challenging, in part because exsting tools embed assumptions about what people want to gain from tracking

- What to track and how to align their tracking to their needs. Obtaining relevant and useful knowledge from tracking, Recongnizing when and how to adjust their tracking, Feeling prepared to discuss their care with their clinicians, Seeking expertise where they most need it

# 3 MigraineTracker System
---
- user-centered system : interative and involved cycle of prototyping, development, feedback
1. configuration : is available at the onset of tracking and is modifiable afterwards
	- goal expression - monitoring, learning, anticipation
	- tracking routine - symptoms, treatments, contributors
2. data entry : defined by configuration and provides the inteface individuals regularly use to record information
	- Although it is a possible to support semi-automated tracking within app, the version used in our study only support manual entry.
3. data review : is available as a calendar visualization within the app
	- They indicate Migrain days, symptoms, category using a landing page calendar
	- Summarizes, visualizations, personalized according to each participant's tracking goal

# 4 Deployment Study
---
- RQ 1 : How does tracking based in explicit expression of goals support patients in managing their migraine?
- RQ 2 : How do patient goals and tracking change as they use MigraineTracker over time?

- The first and second authors used a combination of inductive and deductive coding to analyze end of tracking sessions.
	- Deductive coding was informed by models of personal informatics and the goal-directed tracking framework.
	- Inductive coding occured iteratively as we constructed new theme
