- previous study of self-tracking have addressed areas such as food intake, personal fitness, multiple sclerosis(경화증), mindfulness, migraines(편두통), menstrual(생리) tracking, personal finance, mental wellness, productivity
- Use the prototype developed by [[OmniTrack - A Flexible Self-Tracking Approach Leveraging Semi-Automated Tracking]]
- It has been observed that even experienced users fail to make the most of their personal data even if they desire to do so[^9].
- Interpreting the collected data is challenging, so people often turn to health providers for help[^10,52,70]


# 3 Self-E Design and Implementation
---
- enhance usability and test app's several prototype through many user's feedback 
	- transition from independent variable and dependent variable to easy word to prevent confusion
	- Users can customize other aspects of the experiments, such as the independent variable/intervention check-in time, the dependent variable check-in time window, the check-in style(fixed sampling or ESM)
- Results in Self-E include a likelihood percentage and an effect size
	- Presenting a likelihood percentage rather than p-value has been shown to be more understandable for users not well-versed in statics[^18]
