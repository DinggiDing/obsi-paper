- It is currently unknown which data people consume and how it is visualized

RQ 1 : Which data types do people show on their watch faces?
RQ 2 : In which form is the data currently represented?
RQ 3 : What more can we visualize?

# Result
---
### RQ 1
- Health > Weather > Device
- Watch Battery level > Temperature > Step Count > Weather Info
### RQ 2
- Icon + Text was the most common representation type.
### RQ 3
- For example, from health & fitness data that almost all devices track, roughly 62.03% of participants see step counts, but this percentage is less when it comes to heart rate (45.61%), or calories burned (43.88%), and drops drastically for distance traveled (34.65%), floors count (22.97%), sleep, and blood pressure (13.48%).

## Discussion & Future work
- to determine if the wider adoption of visualizations is a question of preference, tasks, a lack of exposure, and if it requiresus to rethink visual encodings for smartwatches.
- Future work needs to establish at which level of granularity information should be displayed
