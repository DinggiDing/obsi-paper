- Self-generted health data are easily accessed through mobile devices, and data visualization is commonly used in applications.
- 13 papers were analyzed for types of data, characteristics of visualizations, and effectiveness for healthcare management.
- This paper suggest 6 levels for categorizing the efficacy of visualizations that take into account cognitive and physical changes in users.

# 1 Introduction
---
- The data types collected during daily life can also be diverse; they include step counts from activity trackers, nutrition consumption, and sleep cycle data. These data are called self-generated health data.
- Along with blood pressure and blood sugar levl data, health history, symptoms data are called patient-generated data
- In this study, we investigated how visualizations are used; what kind of data they use, how they impact users, and which factors should be considered for proper visualization design.

# 4 Results

### 1. Visualization Characteristics
- We are largely able to divide visualization into 2 categories: data visualization and infographics.

# 5 Dicussion

- we suggest researches and service providers consider the following key points
	1. visualizations should be carefully designed by the selection of data to be shown, what type of visualization is effective, and what task should be supported by the visualization.
	2. proper visualizations should be selected according to the data type and the main task that the developers indicated. Differen visualizations support different tasks.
		- Several applications lack providing line charts or the ability to manipulate the time axis of visualization results.
		- Interactive visualization are also important (filtering dates or zooming actions with finger)
- As users will have varying visual literacy skills, reseacher or service providers need to educate users so that they can comprehend data properly.
