- in-lab [[Think-Aloud]]study
- RQ1 : How do people reflect on their self-tracking data?
- RQ2 : What insights do people gain from visual data exploration?

- Q-selfers : People who persistently record and analyze various health, excercise, sleep, activity data on their own

- It is challenging for lay people to construct appropriate visualizations, translate questions into data attributes, choose visual mappings, and interpret the visualizations [21, 36]

#### Lower level Reflection →  Higher Level Reflection
- Lower level Reflection : Min, Max, Average of value of each data stream
- Participants reaction 
	- They did not have much experence with reflection
	- They enjoyed gaining insight from simply looking at the data summaries (many were surprised that they had been collecting a lot more data than they initially thought)
#### Insight Gaining Patterns with Visual Data Exploration
- the peaks or extreme values led to memories that they had forgotten
- visual data exploration can promote people to quickly generate questions and interact with the visualizations in the spur of the moment to seek answers.

- It is a promising avenue to explore more advanced ways to help people form hypotheses and query them using more powerful visualizations that can highlight differences and correlations understandable by a wide audience.
