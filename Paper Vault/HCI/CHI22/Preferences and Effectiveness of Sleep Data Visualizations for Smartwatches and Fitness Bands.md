![[Preferences and Effectiveness of Sleep Data Visualizations for smartwatches and Fitness Bands.png]]

- Users prefer visual sleep data over text-based data, effectiveness increases with simple visualizations on smaller screens
- The study evaluates user preferences for sleep visualizations across smartwatch and fitness band displays, concluding that simpler, intuitive visuals are most effective for sleep dat
- the most viewed type of sleep data by user is Weekly sleep duration and nightly sleep phases
- High preference for hypnogram visualizations, despite their complexity on smaller screens.

# 1 Introduction
---
- Their results indicated that the most prefered visualizations were often similar for people who wore **smartwatches**, and those who wore **fitness bands**, even though the fitness band-sized visualizations were roughly half the size of the smartwatch-sized ones
- To make recommandations about visualizations to use for sleep data, They implement 3 quantitive studies about the effectiveness of preferred visualizations across three types of form factors(smartwatch, horizontal, and vertical fitness band)

# 3 Understanding Sleep Visualization Preferences
---
- The question asked participants to describe what they would like to learn about their sleep duration and phases.
- Most participants mentioned checking their sleep data only on the phone app
- Participants were most interested in Last Night, followed by the Weekly Overview and Monthly Overview
-  On average, 49% of the participants reported choosing the representation considering both the displayed data and the corresponding encoding.

# 4 Studies Comparing Sleep Visualization
---
**Q**. How does display form factor, expressed as display size, and orientation, affect the effectiveness with which people can answer questions about sleep data? (with 3 studies)
-  Using [[2AFC]] design to check stimulus visualization

#### 2 Stimuli
- Square shape smartwatches, horizontal wristband, vertical wristband

# 5 In-person Pilot Study: Bar charts of weekly sleep durations
---
- They used weekly sleep data instend of last night's sleep as it provide a richer source of data
- With Smartwatch

#### 1 Stimuli and Tasks
- **Representation Choice** - The most preferred visualizations for a weekly overview of sleep durations were the area chart, and floating bar chart
- **Task Choice**
	- T1: On which day did you sleep longer: Saturday or Sunday?
	- T2: Did you go to bed later than planned (22:00) on 4 or more days this week?
	- T3: Did you sleep longer on average on the weekend days (Sat, Sun) compared to the weekdays (Mon-Fri)?
#### 4 Result
 - For T1, Wide was slower than the other two. For T2, Tall was slower than the other two. In T3, we saw a potential trend for Wide being slower than Square .

# 6 SLEEP DURATION (BAR) STUDY: BAR CHARTS OF WEEKLY SLEEP DURATIONS
---
- Crowdsourced study
- With Smartphone
#### 4 Result
- The most obvious diference between form factors in this study was present in T2, for which Wide was both faster, and more accurate than Tall .
- there are trends in T1 for Wide to be slower than Square and Tall .

# 7 Sleep Phase (Hyponogram) Study: Hyponogram Charts of Nightly Sleep Phases
---
- A hypnogram represents the stages of sleep as a function of time.
- The purpose of a hypnogram is to provide a general sense of nightly sleep behaviors

- T1: Were you in the wake phase more than or equal to 4 times?
- T2: Did you have 4 or more transitions from REM to light sleep?
- T3: Did you spend more time in REM than in deep sleep?
#### Result
- Most diferences were visible in T2, with Tall performing worse than Square and Wide in terms of both time, and accuracy.
