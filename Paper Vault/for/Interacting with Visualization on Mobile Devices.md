## 3.1 Foundation
- We organize our overview according to interaction modalities
	- Touch Interaction
	- Spatial Interaction
	- Voice Interaction
### 3.1.1. Interacting with Visualization
- the data may also have a dynamic nature, where new data may provoke new questions.
- As a result, a single static representation of data often does not suffice

## 3.2 Overview
- As suggested by Table 3.1, nearly all of the projects that we surveyed incorporate touch interaction.

### 3.2.1 Touch Interaction
- several challenges 
	- fat finger problem
		- alternative approaches - multi-step, hierarchical selection, modal menu panel, a modal zoom lens, large invisible touch target, voronoi tessellation
	- simultaneous visibility and selectability of targets due to occlusion from the finger or hand
	- unintended touch
	- misinterpreted touch
		- confusing a pinch touch with rotation interaction
	- relative lack of unique, differentiable gestures for initiating different operations.
		- more complex multi-finger or bimanual gestures, theses are correspondingly more difficult to discover and remember
		- new gestures are difficult to perform, memorize, and discover.
		- they advocate for *postures* that re-use and combine simpler interactions for direct parameter control, and that such postures are easier to remember and discover than a set of gestures
- Touch Intearaction on Tablets
	- TouchWave : a set of multi-touch interactions specifically tailored for directly manipulating stacked area charts on tablets without relying on widgets and mode switches
	- TouchViz : Post-WIMP Interface
