- The needs of non-expert users, the nature of the data being represented, and the mobile environment are often not prioritised in these frameworks, leading to visualisations that do not meet user needs and expectations

# 1 Introduction
---
- A well-designed data visualisation framework can enhance user engagement, provide actionable insights, and help users make informed decisions about their health.
- They discovered that there was dissatisfaction among end-users and challenges in using charts to track health data.
- These difficulties encompassed various aspects of the charts such as functionality, data displayed, styling, lack of adaptability for diverse user groups and the overall data visualization interface.
- The 6DVF includes 6 dimensions
	1. identifying the target audience
	2. chart functionality
	3. data representation
	4. visual design and interactivity
	5. target device
	6. single/app visualization interface

# 3 Framework Development
---
### A. The 6 Dimensions
- 6DVF builds on existing guidelines and includes additional considerations for non-expert users and the context of mhealth tracking.
1. Empathize & Needs
	- Non-expert user characterisation -  a set of personas
	- Users' needs and pain points -  users' actions, thoughts, pain points, opportunities
	- Target platforms - screen size and interactive capabilities
2. Ideate
	- Data - mapping the data collected with suitable charts, a list of sketched data visualization
	- Design system
		- Look and feel - colour palaette, chart layout, font sizes
		- Interactivity - user interaction (tap, pinch, swap, gestures, voice notes)
	- App visualization - incorporate all the elements identified in the previous step
### B. Framework Checklist
- It includes the framework components we mentioned in Section 3 to be validated using the Consistent, Complete and Correct(3Cs) criteria

# 4 Evaluation
---
- user testing and A/B testing approaches
### A. Part A: Designer study
- Group 1 (Cohort 1) : Participants are introduced to the framework and presented with a case study of a mobile data visualisation scenario
- Group 2 (Cohort 2) : Participants are not made familiar with the framework
### B. Part B : End-user study
- The end-users will receive a link to a survey in which they will evaluate sets A and B of the meal-tracking prototypes designed by the participants in 4-A

# 5 Preliminary Results and Discussion
---
- The designers expressed confidence in using the framework and noted its potential to deliver better chart designs that would meet user needs.
